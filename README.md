# Text Generation with Markov Chains

## Prodigy InfoTech – Generative AI Internship (Task-03)

📌 **Task Objective**  
The objective of this task is to implement a simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains. This task focuses on understanding probabilistic language modeling, where the next word is predicted based on previously observed word transitions.

🛠 **Tools & Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Markov Chain (Statistical Model)

📂 **Project Description**  
In this project, a Markov Chain model is built using a given text dataset. The model learns word-to-word transitions and generates new text by probabilistically predicting the next word based on the current word.

This task highlights how text generation can be achieved using statistical methods without relying on deep learning models.

🔄 **Workflow**  
1. Prepare and preprocess training text  
2. Build Markov Chain transition dictionary  
3. Generate text based on word probabilities  
4. Analyze the generated output

## 🔍 **Extra Showcase – Markov Text Generation Application (Web App)**

As an additional showcase beyond the mandatory task requirements, a **Markov Text Generation Web Application** was developed to demonstrate the practical implementation of Markov Chains in a real-time web environment.

This application allows users to enter a starting word and generates text dynamically using a Markov Chain–based backend.
